# Ironman Mode

You can play as an ironman, however, this will reset your entire account, to a fresh start.

**Note:** You're allowed to have an ironman account and a non-ironman account. However, this requires you to run 2 discord accounts, and is only if you want to.

To become an Ironman, use either of the following:

* `+m ironman`
* `+m ironman --permanent`

The obvious difference between permanent and non-permanent is that you can de-iron if you are not permanent. However, you CANNOT de-iron if you already have a main account.

Any ironman can acquire the minion icons for half the sacrifice cost. See [Minion Icons](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/#minion-icons).

### Permanent Ironman Perks

Being a _permanent ironman_ provides some perks such as:

* Shared patron perks between main and ironman accounts
* Ironman armour (use: `+m ironman --armor`)

### Ironman Leaderboards

Any leaderboard can be filtered to only show ironmen. This is done by adding `--im` at the end of any `+lb` command.

* E.g. `+lb kc vorkath --im`
* E.g. `+lb sacrifice --im`
* E.g. `+drystreak corp, elysian sigil --im` (T3 patrons only)
