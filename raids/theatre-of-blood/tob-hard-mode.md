# ToB - Hard Mode

Hard mode is much the same as normal mode. Previously the boost max score was above 100% but is now capped at 100% in line with normal mode.&#x20;

For Hard mode, the entire team must have 100% boost score to achieve the fastest times. You can use rune arrows whilst maintaining 100% boost score (99.5% gear score) however dragon darts must be used for 100% boost regardless of arrows.
