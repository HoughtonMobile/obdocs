# Theatre of Blood (ToB)

The Theatre Of Blood is a high-level raid you can do for some good loot. You get faster, and better, at ToB after more attempts and KC.

You can do the Theatre of Blood using +tob start, you can make the raid automatically start when 4 people join, doing `+tob start 4` (or replace with another number).

You can do `+tob start --hard` to start a Hard mode raid.

You can find a team to do ToB in the official server at discord.gg/ob

You can see your KC, attempts and death chances using `+tob`

## Boosts

### Speed Boosts

There are no direct speed boosts, these items affect your boost score (see theory section).

* Better darts directly affect your boost score rather than your gear score.
* Having more attempts/KC
* Scythe > Blade > Tentacle (in melee outfit)
* Twisted bow (in range outfit)
* Dragon warhammer > Bandos godsword (in bank)
* Penalty for not having elite void, bigger penalty for not having normal void either.
* Dragon claws > Crystal halberd (in bank)

### Death Reduction

* Having more attempts/KC
* Having better gear



## Blowpipe, Abyssal Tentacle, Sanguinesti staff and Scythe of Vitur

You can charge the Blowpipe using: `+m blowpipe add 100 dragon dart, 1000 zulrah's scales`

You can create an Abyssal Tentacle using: `+create Abyssal tentacle`

You can add charges to your Abyssal Tentacle using `+m charge tent, 1`

You can charge a Sanguinesti Staff using `+m charge sang, 1000` - this has no use a ToB.&#x20;

The Scythe isn't charged. It is created from an uncharged scythe with `+create scythe of vitur` and uses blood runes/vials of blood as you use it.
