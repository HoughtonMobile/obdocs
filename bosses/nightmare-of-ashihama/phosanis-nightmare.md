# Phosani's Nightmare

## Overview

Phosani's Nightmare is a more difficult; solo-only version of The Nightmare of Ashihama. It drops the same items as the normal Nightmare, as well as the [Parasitic egg](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Parasitic\_egg) and the [Slepey tablet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slepey\_tablet).\
While unique items are rarer from Phosani's Nightmare than they are from the regular Nightmare, Phosani's Nightmare can be killed significantly faster, capping out at 2kc per trip (4kc if patreon).
