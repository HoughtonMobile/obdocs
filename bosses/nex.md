# Nex

### Requirements

* Frozen Key
  * Defeat one of each [God Wars Dungeon Boss](broken-reference) and then use `/create` to create a Frozen Key
* Level 90 Ranged, Level 90 Defence, Level 74 Prayer
* Good range gear in range setup. Including a weapon (Armadyl Crossbow, Dragon Crossbow, Zaryte Crossbow, Twisted Bow) and ammo (Dragon/rune arrows, or Ruby Dragon Bolts (e)).&#x20;
* Supplies: `8x Saradomin Brew, 5x Super Restore, 2x Ranging Potions, 1x Sanfew Serum, 200x ammo` regardless of trip length/quantity.

### Boosts & BIS

* Rune arrows are negative/slower than dragon arrows.
* Zaryte Crossbow is the best in weapon slot.
* Zaryte vambraces are BIS in gloves slot.
* Rigour (Dexterous Prayer Scroll used) gives a boost.
* If using an ely or spectral, your maximum trip length will be longer! This is a new mechanic not really used elsewhere. It means you can kill extra nex's per trip, because they let you sustain for longer. Note: The time is applied per user, e.g. maybe +3 mins per user in the team, for the maximum increase, everyone in the team needs one.
* Spectral has best mage defence bonus in the shield slot.
* Ely reduces death chance by 30%.
* You get faster at killing Nex based on your Offence Boost % (gear) and your KC.\


#### BIS Gear

Zaryte Crossbow + Ely, Armadyl Crossbow + Ely, Armadyl Crossbow + Spectral, Twisted Bow (Best to worst)
