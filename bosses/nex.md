# Nex

### Requirements

* Good range gear in range setup. Including a weapon (acb, dcb, zcb, tbow) and ammo (Dragon/rune arrows, or ruby dragon bolts (e)). Atleast 200 of the ammo youre using.
* Supplies: 8 brews, 5 restores, 2 range pots, 1 sanfews, regardless of trip length/quantity.
* 90 def, 90 ranged, 74 prayer

### Boosts & BIS

* Rune arrows are negative/slower than dragon arrows.
* ZCB is the best in slot weapon.
* Zaryte vambs are BiS.
* Rigour (dex scroll used) gives a boost.
* If using an ely or spectral, your maximum trip length will be longer! This is a new mechanic not really used elsewhere. It means you can kill extra nex's per trip, because they let you sustain for longer. Note: The time is applied per user, e.g. maybe +3mins per user in the team, for the maximum increase, everyone in the team needs one.
* Ely reduces death chance significantly.
* You get faster at killing Nex based on your Offence% (gear) and your KC.

Zcb/Ely, Acb/Ely, Acb/Spectral, Tbow. Best to worst\
