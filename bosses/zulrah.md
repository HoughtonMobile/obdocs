![](<../.gitbook/assets/Magic fang.png>) **Magic fang**

The Magic fang can be used to create 2 different staves (requires 59 crafting) and both provide boosts to Kraken and Thermy bosses. Once created, these 2 items _cannot_ be reverted. Neither item can be charged.

* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Toxic staff (uncharged)`
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Uncharged toxic trident`

The Serpentine helm can be crafted from the visage (requires 52 crafting), however, currently provides _no boosts_ anywhere within the bot. It also _cannot_ be charged.

The helm can be created with the following command:
