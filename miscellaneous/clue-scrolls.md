# Clue Scrolls

### Beginner Clues

Obor/Bryophyta for guaranteed beginners

Alternatively can kill men/goblins for easies and beginners

### Easy Clues

Pickpocketing Male HAM Members, send trips of \~50. Average easy clue takes \~1-2 minutes to obtain this way.

### Medium Clues

Puro puro is 330 eclectics/hr at high level, resulting in a medium clue every \~5 minutes for time spent. [Tier 2 Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/oldschoolbot) can use "open\_until" for the medium clues making this very quick and easy.

Killing \~100 guards at a time with a cannon is an alternative for slightly slower meds/hour, but doesn't require opening a bunch of implings for the clue.

### Hard Clues

As many hard clues come passively, doing slayer with a good [blocklist](../skills/slayer/) is the recommended way to obtain hard clues, as superiors will result in quite a few totem pieces for the guaranteed hard clues from skotizo.

If you'd rather not do slayer, the best method for hard clues/hr is to barrage Warped Jellies.

### Elite Clues

Elite clues generally come passively through pvm, as virtually every boss drops elite clues. It's generally not recommended to camp specifically for elite clues, however, Vorkath is the best pure elite clues per hour at roughly every 2 hours with all boosts.

### Master Clues

Master clues can be created using an easy, medium, hard, and elite clue scroll. This is generally not recommended, as getting masters passively through other clue completions is a much more efficient way to obtain them, due to the length of time required to obtain the elite clues especially, it's usually better to do either mediums or hard clues, and do the masters obtained from those, rather than specifically create master clues.
