# Champions Challenge

Take on one of the greatest challenges in osrs by obtaining all 10 Champion scrolls to secure the elusive Champions' Cape. While not as difficult as in the real game, it can still take many days, weeks or even months to collect all the scrolls.

The challenges work slightly different in the bot as you only need to collect all 10, rather than kill all 10 champions separately. Once you have all 10 scrolls, simply run the following command to receive the cape:&#x20;

`/activities champions_challenge`

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot fail the challenge.
{% endhint %}

To check what scrolls you currently own, use the following command:

`/bank`` `**`format:`**` ``text_paged`` `**`filter:`**` ``Champion's Challenge`

## Champion Scrolls

All scrolls have a 1/5000 drop rate from their respective monsters.
