# Questing

There are various activities within the bot that require a specific amount of quest points to access. These requirements mimic the real requirements in OSRS. Every questing trip is 30 minutes long. The maximum amount of quest points you can currently collect is: 289.

To start questing, use the following command:

* `/activities quest`

## Preface Notes

* The amount of quest points given per trip is as follows:
  * 1-3 - Between 1-99QP
  * 1-2 - Between 100-199QP
  * 1 - Between 200-289QP
* It takes approximately \~115 hours to complete the quest cape.
* If you have level 1 Herblore and complete a questing trip, you have a 50% chance to be given 250xp in Herblore to allow your minion to start the Herblore skill.
* If you have level 1 Magic and complete a questing trip, you have a 50% chance to be given 325xp in Magic for theoretical completion of Witch's Potion.
* If you have less than 1000 Magic xp and complete a questing trip after 15QP, you have a 50% chance to be given 1000xp in Magic for theoretical completion of Fairytale Part 1 quest.
* If you have level 40 or higher Cooking, less than 2500xp in Magic, and you complete a questing trip after 50QP, you have a 50% chance to gain 2500xp in Magic for theoretical completion of an RFD miniquest.

## Boosts

* 10% speed boost for equipping full graceful (can be equipped anywhere)
