# Prayer

You can train Prayer by burying bones, or offering them to the Chaos altar. For example to bury 100 Dragon bones, you can do  /`bury 100 Dragon bones`, or to bury the maximum amount you can: /`bury Dragon bones`.

Offering the bones to the Chaos altar works exactly the same, except you use `+offer` instead, for example:  /`offer 100 Dragon bones`.

The Chaos Altar works like ingame, your minion will do 1 inventory trips back and forth to sacrifice, with a 10% chance of being PKed in the trip and losing some amount of your inventory of bones (depending on if you got PKed at the start/middle/finish).

The Prayer skill is also required alongside smithing in order to create the Spirit shields.
