# Prayer

There are 2 methods to training your Prayer: burying/offering bones and using ensouled heads.

### Burying/Offering Bones

You can train Prayer by burying bones, or offering them to the Chaos altar. For example to bury Dragon bones, you can do `/activities bury`` `**`name:`**` ``Dragon bones`. You can also specify an amount but this is optional as it will default to the maximum. This should never be done as the Chaos alter gives over 6x more xp per bone, even including the chance to lose bones to pkers.

Offering the bones to the Chaos altar works exactly the same, except you use `/offer` instead, for example: `/offer`` `**`name:`**` ``Dragon bones`.

The Chaos Altar works like ingame, your minion will do 1 inventory trips back and forth to sacrifice, with a 10% chance of being PKed in the trip and losing some amount of your inventory of bones (depending on if you got PKed at the start/middle/finish).

### Ensouled Heads

Through slayer and other combat related activities, you may obtain ensouled heads in various forms. You can use these heads for Prayer xp by using the `/k` command. They require a specific magic level to kill along with a rune cost for each cast. To view the rune cost and xp given, visit the [Ensouled heads page](ensouled-heads.md).

The Prayer skill is also required alongside smithing in order to create the Spirit shields.
