# Runecrafting

You can train Runecrafting using `+rc [quantity] <rune>`, for example `+rc 50 law`.

You can create Runecrafting pouches using `+create`, they require different crafting levels based on the tier, as well as leather. Similarly to in-game, higher tier pouches also require higher Runecrafting levels to use. These boost the amount of essence you can carry in 1 inventory, increasing XP/Hr.
