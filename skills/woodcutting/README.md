# Woodcutting

You can train Woodcutting using  `+chop [quantity] <logs>`, for example  `+chop 50 willow`. Alternatively, if you would like your minion to cut as many logs as possible in a single task, you can use  `+chop <logs>`, for example `+chop willow`.

The bot uses XP rates based off rune axe as standard; however, you can get one of the following boosts from owning one of these axes:

* Dragon axe: +9% (level 61)
* Infernal axe: +9% (level 61)
* Crystal axe: +12% (level 61)

### Lumberjack Outfit

You can obtain the Lumberjack outfit through the [Temple Trekking](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/temple-trekking) minigame. When equipped in the skilling setup, it provides the following boosts to woodcutting XP:

* 0.4% - Lumberjack hat
* 0.8% - Lumberjack top
* 0.6% - Lumberjack legs
* 0.2% - Lumberjack boots
* 2.5% - Full outfit equipped in skilling setup
