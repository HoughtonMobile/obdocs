# Hunter Training

## Fastest Route to 99:

Full graceful provides a 5% boost to all hunter creatures, except birdhouses where it gives a 10% boost. It _must_ be equipped in the skilling setup.

**Passive XP + seeds** \
/`birdhouse` or  /`bh` \
You can set birdhouse traps to collect various seeds, rings, and eggs. This can be done every 50 minutes which provides excellent xp. See the [Birdhouses](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/hunter/birdhouses) page for more info.

\
**Optimal route for EHP hunter & fishing** \
/`aerialfish or /aerial` (from 35 hunter and 45 fishing)

**Optimal route for active hunter XP**\
_Numbers may not be accurate if you're unlucky with RNG_\
/`hunt 23 polar kebbit` (to 7+)\
/`hunt feldip weasel` (to 16+)\
/`hunt ruby harvest` (to 25+) (hunt 20 more if needed)\
/`hunt 200 sapphire glacialis` (to 29+)\
/`hunt swamp lizard` (to 43)\
/`hunt spotted kebbit` (to 57)\
/`hunt dark kebbit` (to 60)\
/`hunt red salamander` (to 67)\
/`hunt black salamander` (to 73)\
/`hunt black chinchompa` (to 99)\


### Additional Information:

If you wish to avoid using brews/restores/gear, you can alternatively do Red Chinchompas starting at 63.

Herbi is an option at 80 Hunter/31 Herblore, with rates up to 160k xp/hr with staminas, \~125k without.

Another option is Aerial Fishing, requiring 35 Hunter/43 Fishing, which is the best method if you want both 99s.
