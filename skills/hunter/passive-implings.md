# Passive Implings

As your minion is on a trip, it will automatically catch any implings it finds, provided it has the hunter level to catch them with a net (you don't actually need to buy a net).

You can view the collection log for implings with `+cl implings`.

## How It Works

There is a 1/85 chance of your minion finding an impling _every minute of your trip_, provided your trip is over 4 minutes in length and you're not completing the fight caves, inferno, ToB, or some minigames (Barb Assault, Castle Wars, LMS, Pest Control).

Each impling has a weighting that determines which impling you will receive when you do hit the 1/85 chance. The total of all weightings is 349. This means that each impling (except crystal) has a X/349 chance to be caught _if_ you hit the 1/85, X being the specific weight of each impling type.&#x20;

For example, you receive 1x Baby impling during your 30 minute trip. That means, you had 30 rolls at the 1/85 chance to find an impling, and you successfully hit the 1/85 once during your trip. The weight of a Baby impling is 66. That means, you then hit the 66/349 chance for a Baby impling.

The odds of catching a Baby imp every minute are 1/449 (the maths is: 1/85 x 66/349). Theoretically, you have about a 1/15 chance to catch a Baby imp every 30 minutes.

The chance of catching a Lucky impling is 1/29,665 every minute (1/989 every 30 mins).
