# Herblore

### Starting Out

Herblore works as it does in OSRS: you clean herbs, make unfinished potions, prepare your secondary ingredients, and then make your final potions. In order to start training herblore, you need 10 qp to get the starting xp from the Druidic Ritual quest which will take you to level 3 herblore. If you did not have 10 qp when herblore was released, you will have a 50% chance of getting the starting xp when questing post 10 qp.

You can buy vials of water using `+buy (quantity) vial of water`

### Making Potions

Making unfinished potions, cleaning herbs, and preparing secondary ingredients are all done with the /mix command. You can optionally use Zahur & Wesley to make these processes instant for a small fee.

* `/mix`**`name:`**`Crushed nest`
* `/mix`**`name:`**`Toadflax`
* `/mix`**`name:`**`Toadflax potion (unf)`
* `/mix`**`name:`**`Saradomin brew (3)`

**Zahur** - You can add **`zahur:`**`True` to the end of the command to make unfinished potions or clean herbs instantly. This costs 200gp per item. Zahur will not clean herbs that you do not have the require d herblore level to clean yourself. No xp is given for cleaning herbs with Zahur.

* E.g. `/mix`` `**`name:`**`Toadflax`` `**`zahur:`**`True`

**Wesley** - You can add **`wesley:`**`True` to the end of the command to crush your items instantly. This costs 50gp per item. There are no other requirements.

* E.g. `/mix`` `**`name:`**`Crushed nest`` `**`wesley:`**`True`
