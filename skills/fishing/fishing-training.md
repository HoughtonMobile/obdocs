# Fishing Training

## Fastest route to 99:

\+fish Shrimp 1-5\
\+fish Sardine 5-10 (requires fishing bait)\
\+fish Herring 10-20 (requires fishing bait)\
**OPTIONAL**: [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) until Angler (equip set for 2.5% xp boost)\
\+fish Trout 20-30 (requires feathers)\
\+fish Salmon 30-58 (requires feathers)\
**OPTIONAL**: [Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) (reqs minimum 35 hunter) until Pearl barbarian rod (equip for 5% catch boost)\
\+fish barbarian 58-99 (requires feathers)

[Tempoross](tempoross.md) is a good option instead of Barbarian Fishing once you have obtained a crystal tool seed from Zalcano and a Dragon harpoon from Wyrms or Tempeross to create a crystal harpoon. Requires 35 fishing.

### Additional Information:

[Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) when at least 43 fishing/35 hunter, this is much better than doing Hunting or Fishing on their own for training if you're looking to get 99 in both.

**Collection Log Slots obtainable by Fishing**

Bass (Big Bass), Swordfish (Big Swordfish), Shark (Big Shark), [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) (Angler outfit), [Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) (3 Rods+Golden Tench+Fish Sack).
