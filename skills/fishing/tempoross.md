Refer to the [OSRS Tempoross rewards page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Reward\_pool) for the various fish that will be given at your fishing level.
* You can only acquire 1 Fish barrel, Tackle box, Big harpoonfish, and Tiny tempor. If you roll any of these items again, you will be given 25 soaked pages instead.
* Spirit angler outfit can be acquired with `/create`, but provides no additional boost over normal anglers.&#x20;
