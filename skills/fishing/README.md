# Fishing

You can train Fishing using `+fish [quantity] <fish>`, for example `+fish 100 lobster`.

Fishing bait is buyable with `+buy fishing bait`.

Dark fishing bait and Raw Karambwanji aren't sold by the bot and can only be obtained by buying from other players or obtaining them yourself.

### Angler Outfit

It's possible to get the Angler's outfit from [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) as well as [Aerial fishing](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/fishing/aerial-fishing). When equipped in the skilling setup, it provides the following boosts to fishing XP:

* 0.4% - Angler hat
* 0.8% - Angler top
* 0.6% - Angler waders
* 0.2% - Angler boots
* 2.5% - Full outfit equipped in skilling setup
