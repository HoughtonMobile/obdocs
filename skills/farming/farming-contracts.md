# Farming Contracts

An easy way to get additional seeds while farming is to take on a [farming contract](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster\_Jane#Farming\_contracts) from Farming Guildmaster Jane using the `/farming contract` command.&#x20;

**QUICK START -** Using the Autocontract button  harvest your current contract, open a seedpack and get a new contract, or plant your current contract.

#### Farming Level Required

* Easy contract - 45 Farming
* Medium contract - 65 Farming
* Hard contract - 85 Farming

Guildmaster Jane will ask you to grow a crop suitable for your farming level, and upon successfully harvesting the requested crop you will be given a seed pack. If your contract is too difficult, you can use the `/farming contract`` `**`input:`**`easier` command to have Jane downgrade your contract to the next lowest tier. After completing your contract, you can use `/open`` `**`name:`**`Seed pack` to get your seed rewards.
