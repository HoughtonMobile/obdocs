# Farming Contracts

An easy way to get additional seeds while farming is to take on a [farming contract](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster\_Jane#Farming\_contracts) from Farming Guildmaster Jane using the `/farming contract` command.&#x20;

You can take easy contracts at 45 Farming, medium contracts at 65 Farming, and hard contracts at 85 Farming.&#x20;

Guildmaster Jane will ask you to grow a crop suitable for your farming level, and upon successfully harvesting the requested crop you will be given a seed pack. If your contract is too difficult, you can use the `/farming contract` command to have Jane downgrade your contract to the next lowest tier. After completing your contract, you can use `/open [name:Seed pack]` to get your seed rewards.
