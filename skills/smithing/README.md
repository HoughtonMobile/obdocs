# Smithing

Smithing is one of the more useful skills on the bot, because it is required to create many useful items such as godswords, spirit shields and crystal equipment.

You can train smithing by using `+smelt` & `+smith` commands.

* `+smelt [quantity] <bar>`
  * E.g. `+smelt 50 gold bar`
* `+smith [quantity] <item>`
  * E.g. `+smith 100 adamant dart tip`

### Bars

**\*\*** - Equipping [goldsmith gauntlets](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/miscellaneous/buyables) will increase the gold bar xp from 22.5 to 56.2.

### Blast Furnace

An alternative method to train smithing is through use of the blast furnace. At the blast furnace you can expect higher xp/hr and in turn, expect to make more bars/hr. Please visit the [blast furnace page](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/smithing/blast-furnace) to view specifics.

### Items Requiring Smithing

You can smith just about any item from the main game for xp, at exactly the same xp rates. You can see a full list of smithables by typing `+smith --items` in the bot, or by visiting the [OSRS Smithing Wiki page.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Smithing#Smithing)&#x20;

The bot also mimics some of the more useful creatables that require a certain smithing level in the real game too. Here is a list of those items.
