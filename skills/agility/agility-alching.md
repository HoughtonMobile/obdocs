# Agility Alching

You can alch items while training Agility. You select items to be alched, and then add `--alch` to your /`laps` command.

1. Select all the items you want to be alched while training:
   * `/favalch Rune platebody`
2. After selecting one, or lots, of "Favorite alchable items" (favalchs), simply start a laps trip with the `--alch` flag, for example:
   * `/laps ardougne --alch`

It will pick the highest alch-value item from your list of favorites to alch.&#x20;
