# Agility Pyramid

If you're wanting to make some gp while running agility, this is your place. Each successfully completed lap gives 10k gp, while also allowing you to alch during your trip.

## Requirements

* 30 Agility (40+ recommended)

## Fail Rates

Even though you can start at level 30, it is recommended to wait until at least 40 agility to start training here. Here are the fail rates:

* Below level 40 - 95% fail chance
* Below level 50 - 30% fail chance
* Below level 60 - 20% fail chance
* Below level 75 - 5% fail chance
* Above level 75 - 0% fail chance

## Xp/Hour

The base xp for completing one lap is 722xp. However, depending on your agility level, and the amount of successfully completed laps you do, the xp can heavily vary.&#x20;

The formula for a successful lap at the agility pyramid is `722 + (300 + (AgilLvl * 8))`

These rates are taken directly from the OSRS wiki are are subject to some minor variation:

* Level 55–60: 25,000–30,000
* Level 67–70: 33,000–37,000
* Level 75: 42,100
* Level 88–99: 44,700
