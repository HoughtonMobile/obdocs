# Monkey Backpacks

When completing laps of the Ape Atoll agility course you can earn a [monkey backpack](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ape\_Atoll\_Agility\_Course)! These are obtained automatically whenever you reach the lap count required for each backpack.

| **Monkey** | **Required laps** |
| ---------- | :---------------: |
| Karamjan   |        100        |
| Zombie     |        250        |
