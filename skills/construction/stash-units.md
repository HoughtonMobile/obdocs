# Stash Units

You can create clue stash units to store emote clue items in. At this stage, the stash units are not utilised for clues but there are plans for this in the near future.

## Commands

To create a stash space, use the following command:

* `/tools stash_units build_all`

To fill and unfill items from stash spaces, use the following commands:

* `/tools stash_units fill_all`
* `/tools stash_units unfill`` `**`unit:`**` ``[unitName or unitNumber]`

To view which stash units are filled or unfill, use the following commands:

* `/tools stash_units view`` `**`unit:`**` ``[unitName or unitNumber]`
* `/tools stash_units view`` `**`not_filled:`**` ``true/false`

## Requirements & Materials

**NOTE -** All stash units are build with _10 bronze nails only_.
