# Slayer Boosts

You will not receive totem pieces or ancient shards if you are using a cannon as cannons cannot be placed in the catacombs.

You can check the boosts for a specific monster and by how much by using the `/k`` `**`show_info:`**`True` command.\
The Elysian spirit shield will also reduce your food usage by 17.5%, this needs to be equipped to work.  Having a full Justiciar set equipped in your melee will further increase your food reduction by 6.5% on any Melee tasks



### General boosts

You can find boosts for bosses under the [boss boosts page.](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/boosts-and-requirements)\
Cannon boosts a number of bosses by a variable amount, the same applies for bursting and barraging.
