# Thieving

## Thieving

You can train thieving using the `+pickpocket` command. For example, you can `+pickpocket master farmer`. To start training Thieving, you can `+pickpocket man` or `woman`. You will obtain the standard loot from each monster you can pickpocket, all of which can be found on the [OSRS Thieving Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving).

### Alternatives

You can also train thieving via Pyramid Plunder or obtain the Rogues outfit for double loot when pickpocketing any NPC.\
`+plunder` See the [Pyramid Plunder](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/pyramid-plunder) page for details.\
`+rd` See the [Rogues Den](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den) page for details.

### Boosts

**Pyramid Plunder** - 5% for Pharaoh's sceptre, remove 7.5% time penalty for full graceful. \
**Rogues Outfit** - Obtained through [Rogues' Den Minigame](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den). When the full outfit is equipped in skilling, it provides a 100% chance to double all thieving loot.
