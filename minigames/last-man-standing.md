# Last Man Standing

Last Man Standing (LMS) is a solo minigame where you fight other players (i.e. NPCs) to gain points and, as the name suggets, be the last player alive. There are no boosts or requirements to start this minigame. Every 120 games played, your minion will improve within the minigame, attaining higher ranks and more wins.
