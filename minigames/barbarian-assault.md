# Barbarian Assault

Challenge waves of penance monsters with a teammate to unlock the rewards from Barbarian Assault. BA in the bot works a bit differently than BA in OSRS as it was modified to be easier to find teams and earn points. There are no defined roles or role-specific honour levels, there aren't even specific waves. At random, one member of the team will be selected as the Fighter, and that member's melee strength bonus will provide an overall boost to your time spent per wave.

To start a trip of BA, use one of the following commands:

* `+ba start` - starts a mass
* `+ba start solo` - starts a solo trip (-10% penalty to speed)

### Boosts

* Up to 12.5% for melee gear (see below)
* Up to 30.3% for honour level (see below)
* Up to 20% for average KC
* \-10% for solo trips
* 10% more points for completion of Kandarin elite diary (upon return of trip)

### BiS Melee Gear

Your melee gear will provide a boost up to 12.5%. This boost is based on your minions _melee strength bonus_. This is important, especially in masses, because if your minion is chosen as the Fighter role, the team's boost will be dependant on your Melee gear. Below is an image of the best melee strength bonus currently available:

### Barbarian Assault Shop

To spend your honour points on BA items, you can use the `+ba buy` command.

* E.g. `+ba buy fighter torso`

You can also gamble your honour points by using `+ba gamble` command.
