# Gauntlet

The Gauntlet is a solo minigame which has some substantial requirements. To begin a trip into the Gauntlet, use `+gauntlet normal/corrupted quantity` (quantity is optional).

When you start at both the normal and corrupted gauntlets, your chance of death within the minigame will be quite high. This can be reduced through minion learning (down to 6%).

### Requirements

* Level 80 in all combat stats (90 for Corrupted)
* Level 77 Prayer
* Level 70 in the following skills:
  * Smithing
  * Mining
  * Farming
  * Agility
  * Woodcutting
  * Herblore
  * Construction
  * Hunter
* 200+ quest points
* _Corrupted Gauntlet also requires at least 50kc in the normal Gauntlet_.

### Boosts

* Augury & Rigour prayers both provide a 3% boost.
* Higher KC provides a speed boost (up to 20% at 100kc).

### Rewards

* Crystal shards along with runes, gems, arrows, and rune alchables.
* Crystal weapon seeds and crystal armour seeds (currently cannot be made into weapons/armours).
* Enhanced crystal weapon seed which can be made into the Bow of Faerdhinen or Blade of Saeldor. This requires 82 Crafting & Smithing.
  * Currently, only the Bow of Faerdhinen (c) provides boosts at Sara, Arma, CoX, & Zulrah.

`+create blade of saeldor/bow of faerdhinen (inactive)` - Requires 100 shards&#x20;

`+create blade of saeldor/bow of faerdhinen (c)` - Requires 1000 shards

* See the OSRS wiki [Gauntlet Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The\_Gauntlet) for specific drop rates.

### Trading in Crystal Seeds

You may trade in your spare crystal seeds for crystal shards through the `+amrod` command.

* E.g. `+amrod 3 crystal tool seed`
