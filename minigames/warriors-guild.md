# Warriors Guild

You can use the Warriors Guild to get defenders, powerful offensive offhand slot items. You can use sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour to earn guild tokens command. Once you have tokens, you can fight the cyclops housed in the guild to earn bronze through dragon defenders. You are required to have at least 100 tokens before killing the cyclops.

To collect warriors guild tokens:

* `+wg tokens`&#x20;

To kill cyclops for defenders:

* `+wg cyclops`

**NOTE:** Don't equip your defenders until you get dragon! The command checks your bank for current defender rather than equipped gear. You can also get more than one defender in one trip.

If you have attained 99 Attack, you can equip the cape in the _melee setup_ and no longer require any tokens to kill the giants (you do still require the previous tiers of defenders in order to get the next one).

### Armour sets

Each armour set requires the full helm, platebody, and platelegs. You will automatically use the highest tier armour set you can.
