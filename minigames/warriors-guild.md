# Warriors Guild

You can use the Warriors Guild to get defenders, powerful offensive offhand slot items. You can use sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour to earn guild tokens using the  /`wg tokens` command. Once you have tokens, you can fight the cyclops housed in the guild to earn bronze through dragon defenders using the  /`wg cyclops` command.\
\
Hint: Don't equip your defenders until you get dragon! The command checks your bank for current defender rather than equipped gear. You can also get more than one defender in one trip.

Once you have obtained 99 Attack you can equip the cape and no longer require any tokens to kill the giants, (You do still require the previous tiers of defenders in order to get the next one)
